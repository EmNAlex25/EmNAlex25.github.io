    <th>Modifying this bouncing ball was also quite difficult for me. I struggled putting
    the code together and ended up piecing codes together to form my project. I have since

    designs rather than codes.</th>

    circles. However, while attempting to match the processing to my own self portrat,
    it became apparent that it was much harder than I had realized.
